                I serve as one of the board members at the Next Tech Lab. NTL is basically a cool place where nerds come togetherand build cool stuff(atleast that's what i feel like). Well my responsibilties include taking the executive decisions for the entire lab, alsomanage the Norman Lab(the web development sublab), which i hope you guessed it...is the web dev sub-lab. Yes i am the Web Dev kinda nerd.Check our website here [NTL's Website](https://www.youtube.com).`,

                In the summer of 2025, i was recurited by the Rewardsy team as a Front-end intern. My work at first included fixing the bugs in the existing code and later on made new features like an easy to use QR based reward system and an event tracking system using Azure's service bus. Overall it was a great experience and i got to learn a lot about working in a real world setting and meeting actual deadlines, the seniors at the company helped a lot too.`,

                Contributed as a Reasearch Intern under Assistant Professor Dr. Susmi Jacob, where my team worked on a Speech Enhancement and noise filteration system using Machine Learning. We used the Deep Complex Convolution Recurrent Network(DCCRN) model as our base model and fine tuned it to get bettter results. The model was trained on Valentini Dataset, a benchmark Dataset containing thousands of paired clean and noisy speech samples. Through supervised learning, the model learned to map noisy inputs to their clean counterparts, effectively reducing background noise and enhancing speech clarity. We evaluated the model's performance using metrics like PESQ and STOI, achieving significant improvements in audio quality. This project not only deepened my understanding of deep learning techniques but also highlighted the practical applications of machine learning in real-world scenarios.
